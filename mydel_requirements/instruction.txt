COMPOSER.PHAR

Download Composer
Windows Installer

The installer will download composer for you and set up your PATH environment variable so you can simply call composer from any directory.

Download and run Composer-Setup.exe - it will install the latest composer version whenever it is executed.
Command-line installation

Run this in your terminal to get the latest Composer version:

php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" > composer-setup.php
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'a52be7b8724e47499b039d53415953cc3d5b459b9d9c0308301f867921c19efc623b81dfef8fc2be194a5cf56945d223') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

This installer script will simply check some php.ini settings, warn you if they are set incorrectly, and then download the latest composer.phar in the current directory. The 4 lines above will, in order:

    Download the installer to the current directory
    Verify the installer SHA-384 which you can also cross-check here
    Run the installer
    Remove the installer

WARNING: Please do not redistribute the install code. It will change with every version of the installer. Instead, please link to this page.
Installer Options
--install-dir

You can install composer to a specific directory by using the --install-dir option and providing a target directory. Options must be appended to -- so that PHP ignores them, like -- --install-dir=bin, example:
php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin
--filename

You can specify the filename (default: composer.phar) using the --filename option. example:
php composer-setup.php --filename=composer
--version

You can install composer to a specific release by using the --version option and providing a target release. example:
php composer-setup.php --version=1.0.0-alpha8
Preview / Snapshot Releases

By default the installer and composer self-update will download stable versions only. If you would like to help test pre-release versions you can use the --preview flag on either installer or self-update. For snapshot builds which are done from the latest Composer commit, you can use the --snapshot flag.
